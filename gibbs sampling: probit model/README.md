Gibbs Sampling: Probit regression
=================================

Content
-------
 * Source files for pdflatex document
 * `gibbs.py` - TODO - I have to fix it and add it (not public yet).

How to compile the article to pdf 
---------------------------------
On Linux with *recent* Texlive compile pdf by running: 
```sh
# from directory whatsoever_path/notes/gibbs\ sampling:\ probit\ model
$ make
```

It will create the `main.pdf` which is the article.

Change command `TEX_CALL` to `xetex` if you experience problems.
If you still can not compile pdf, write me!
I was compiling with with the default option pdflatex 
`pdfTeX 3.1415926-2.4-1.40.13 (TeX Live 2012/Debian)`
and it was OK.

TODO
----
Any (constructive) feedback is welcomed. Thanks to Matej and Ondra for reporting the compilation bug.
 * Fix missing explanation, spelling, English
 * Fix code and add it
